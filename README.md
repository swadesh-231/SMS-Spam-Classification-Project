# SMS-Spam-Classification-Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for SMS spam classification. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify spam messages, enabling effective spam filtering and improving user experience.

Project Highlights:
- Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification.
- Implements a preprocessing pipeline using the 'tm' package for text cleaning and transformation.
- Creates a document-term matrix to represent text data numerically.
- Identifies frequently used words and filters the document-term matrix accordingly.
- Converts counts to binary values for classification.
- Evaluates the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrix.
